This repository curates a collection of open-source projects, libraries, and tools focused on **OpenAI-based real-time conversation api**. 

## Introduction

The **OpenAI Realtime API** enables developers to create dynamic conversational experiences with **text and audio input/output**, providing **native speech-to-speech** conversions without text intermediaries. With **natural, steerable voices**, the models can adapt tone, inflections, and handle functions such as laughing or whispering. This API delivers simultaneous **text moderation** and **faster-than-realtime audio playback**, optimizing real-time interactions.

Whether you’re interested in AI-powered chat, real-time communication tools, or multimodal applications, this list of open-source projects showcases the power of real-time systems.

## OpenAI-based 

### 

Explore applications powered by the OpenAI Realtime API, enhancing the conversational experience:

- **[openai-realtime-proxy](https://github.com/m1guelpf/openai-realtime-proxy)**  
  A proxy solution that allows the deployment of OpenAI's Realtime APIs in production environments. It simplifies tasks like authentication and rate-limiting, enabling seamless voice-to-voice conversations. This project can be deployed in less than 5 minutes.

- **[OpenAI Realtime Console](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console)**  
  An interactive demo application designed to showcase the capabilities of the OpenAI Realtime API. It visualizes the flow of events in real-time interactions, though not intended for production use.

- **[Ell Realtime](https://github.com/MadcowD/ell/tree/d02a2f9a0890d5b398b7f9fb052b796367256649/x/openai_realtime)**  
  A python toolkit built to facilitate OpenAI Realtime API integrations within existing applications, helping developers implement real-time audio and text interactions.

- **[Live Translation with OpenAI Realtime API](https://github.com/twilio-samples/live-translation-openai-realtime-api)**  
  A real-time translation system built using OpenAI's Realtime API and Twilio. It offers live translations during audio conversations, useful for building multilingual communication platforms.
